  <p>
    Hi! 🙋🏻 My name is <a
      href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-moran228"
      target="_blank">Pedro Moran</a
    >, self-taught frontend developer with more than 2 years of experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm 21 years old and was born in <strong>Venezuela</strong> 🇻🇪 but currently
    living in
    <strong>Argentina</strong> 🇦🇷.
  </p>
  <p>
    I usually study and keep myself updated with online resources like <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/"
      target="_blank">MDN</a
    >, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Udemy</a>, <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/"
      target="_blank">Youtube</a
    > or specific Blogs.
  </p>
  <p>
    My native language is <strong>Spanish</strong> but I have an
    <strong>upper-intermediate</strong> level of English.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like popular music genres like pop, rock and indie, sometimes less
    listened genres like metal. Also love cooking at home and tasting different
    types of food, especially gourmet food.
