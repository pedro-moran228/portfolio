        I participated as frontend developer in a first and second version of
        Lippia Test Manager.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first version, I was in charge of planning, functional design and
        development implementing features such as:
      </p>
      <ul
        class={classNames(
          "space-y-1 mt-2 [&>li]:marker",
          `[&>li]:before:${color}`
        )}
      >
        <li>Dynamic routes with Single Page Application.</li>
        <li>
          Estados globales con <strong>useContext</strong> y <strong
            >useReducer</strong
          >.
        </li>
        <li>Global states with useContext and useReducer.</li>
        <li>React Custom hooks.</li>
        <li>Forms.</li>
        <li>Internationalization.</li>
        <li>
          Authentication and user management with <strong>Keycloak</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>Data fetching.</li>
        <li>Multifunctional tables.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This first version was discarded and it was decided to start a second
        version as an MVP.
      </p>
      <Carousel
        color={color}
        className="hidden md:block"
        slices={images}
        client:visible
      />
    </div>
    <Slider className="block md:hidden" slices={images} />
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        Among the big challenges I managed to complete are the migration of the <strong
          >Create React App</strong
        > tool to <strong>Vite</strong> and the upgrade from <strong
          >React v17</strong
        > to <strong>React v18</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Improved software quality in both efficiency and scalability by
        standardizing <strong>S.O.L.I.D</strong> principles, best practices and
        techniques such as <strong>lazy loading</strong> to improve user
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from my role in the frontend I also helped with the backend
        development as it was done in <strong>NestJs</strong> (Javascript). With
        my contributions I was able to improve up to <strong>300%</strong> the
        efficiency of the backend in operations such as data collection and
        retrieval.
